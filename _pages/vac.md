#### Prospective Students
I am always looking for self-motivated students from various background to work with me on pushing the boundary of formal methods towards building more trustworthy AI and more secure systems. Our group encourages high-quality research with theoretical depth or practical impact to the broad audiences like formal methods, software engineering, AI/ML and security.  

**Prerequisites.** An ideal PhD candidate should have a strong background in mathematics, logic, programming, and more importantly love doing research. 



#### Research Positions

If you are interested in a research position (PostDoc/research assistant/research intern) in our group, feel free to drop me an email with CV.
