#### Prospective Students
I always welcome applications from self-motivated students from various background to push the boundary of engineering trustworthy AI models/applications/systems and provable secure systems. In particular, our group encourages high-quality and cutting-edge research with theoretical depth or practical impact to the broad audiences like formal methods, software engineering, AI/ML and security. 

**Prerequisites.** An ideal candidate should have a strong background in mathematics, logic, programming, and more importantly love doing research. 



#### Research Positions

I am always looking for self-motivated PostDoc/research assistants/research interns to work with me at ZJU. Feel free to drop me an email with CV if you are interested.
