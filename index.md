I am a US-equivalent tenure-track Assistant Professor leading the [IS2 (Intelligent System Security) Lab](http://is2lab.github.io) at [School of Control Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), Hangzhou, China.


#### Experience

<!-- - July 2020 - present, Assistant Professor, Zhejiang University
- April 2019 - June 2020, Research Fellow, National University of Singapore, Supervisor: Prof. [Dong Jin Song](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/)
- April 2018 - April 2019, Research Fellow, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Supervisor: Prof. [Sun Jun](https://sunjun.site/) -->

I was a research fellow with Prof. [Dong Jin Song](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/) at [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) (2019.04-2020.06). Before that, I was a research fellow with Prof. [Sun Jun](https://sunjun.site/) at the pillar of [Information Systems Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/), [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) (2018.04-2019.04), where I received my Ph.D. in March 2018. I obtained my B.E. in Information Engineering from [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) in July 2013.

#### Research Interest

In general, my research goal is to *develop rigorous engineering methodologies towards building more trustworthy intelligent systems or software*. Currently, I am particularly interested in the following research topics in the intersection of formal methods, software engineering, artificial intelligence (AI) and security:
- Testing, verification and repair of AI or AI-based systems, e.g., deep neural networks, large language models (LLMs);
- AI safety and fairness, e.g., for LLMs or LLM-based systems/applications;
- Verification of concurrent (reactive) systems, e.g., OS kernels and distributed control systems;
- Verification of security protocols;
- Other related topics like fuzzing, symbolic execution, runtime verification, etc.

Collaborations are warmly welcome from both academia or industry!

<!-- my research concerns *how to better design, implement and analyze systems, with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) systems and cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous driving car, industrial control system, and recommendation system, using various software engineering (SE) techniques ranging from formal methods, program analysis to software testing.* <u>Most of my recent works are focused on testing and enhancing the robustness or fairness of deep learning models deployed in different application domains to improve the system reliability and security.</u> -->

##### Awards
I was very fortunate to receive two [*ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ICSE (2018 and 2020)*](https://www.sigsoft.org/awards/distinguishedPaperAward.html). The ICSE 2020 paper on fairness testing of deep neural networks is also selected as [*ACM SIGSOFT Research Highlights*](https://www.sigsoft.org/resources/highlights.html).

<!-- #### Vacancies -->

<!-- <font color="#dd0000">
I am actively looking for self-motivated PostDoc/PhD/master/research assistants/research interns to work with me at ZJU. </font>
Feel free to drop me an email with CV if you are interested. Preferred PhD candidates should have a strong background in logic, mathematics or programming, and more importantly love doing research. For ZJU students, please walk in to my office at Lecture Building 9-350, if you wish to have a talk.

#### Hobbies

- I play badminton regularly;
- I love to play DOTA2 and PES when I have the time.
