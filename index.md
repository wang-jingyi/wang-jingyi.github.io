I am a US-equivalent tenure-track Assistant Professor leading the [IS2 Lab](http://is2lab.github.io) at [School of Control Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), Hangzhou, China.


#### Experience

<!-- - July 2020 - present, Assistant Professor, Zhejiang University
- April 2019 - June 2020, Research Fellow, National University of Singapore, Supervisor: Prof. [Dong Jin Song](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/)
- April 2018 - April 2019, Research Fellow, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Supervisor: Prof. [Sun Jun](https://sunjun.site/) -->

I was a research fellow with Prof. [Dong Jin Song](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/) at [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) (2019.04-2020.06). Before that, I was a research fellow with Prof. [Sun Jun](https://sunjun.site/) at the pillar of [Information Systems Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/), [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) (2018.04-2019.04), where I received my Ph.D. in March 2018. I obtained my B.E. in Information Engineering from [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) in July 2013.

#### Research Interest

In general, my research aims to *build more trustworthy intelligent systems or software with the help of formal methods or software engineering techniques*. Currently, I am particularly interested in the following research topics:
- Testing, verification and repair of artificial intelligence (AI) systems;
- Verification of concurrent reactive systems, e.g., OS kernels and industrial control systems;
- AI-assisted modeling and verification of security protocols;
- Other related topics like fuzzing, symbolic execution, runtime monitoring, etc.

Collaborations are warmly welcome from both academia or industry!

<!-- my research concerns *how to better design, implement and analyze systems, with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) systems and cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous driving car, industrial control system, and recommendation system, using various software engineering (SE) techniques ranging from formal methods, program analysis to software testing.* <u>Most of my recent works are focused on testing and enhancing the robustness or fairness of deep learning models deployed in different application domains to improve the system reliability and security.</u> -->

#### Vacancies

<font color="#dd0000">
*I am actively looking for self-motivated PostDoc/PhD/master/research assistants/research interns to work with me at ZJU.* </font> Feel free to drop me an email with CV if you are interested and find any of the above research topics interesting. Preferred PhD candidates should have a strong background in logic, mathematics or programming, and more importantly love doing research. For ZJU students, please walk in to my office at Lecture Building 9-350, if you wish to have a talk.


#### Hobbies

- I play badminton regularly;
- I love to play DOTA2 and PES when I have the time;
- I love football and am a fan of Leo Messi, GOAT!
